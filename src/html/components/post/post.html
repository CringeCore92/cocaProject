        Depending on the input, this can result in using a lot of processing
        power and time. The whole process would take approximately 5 seconds to
        return a result to the client. Keep in mind we’re talking about 1 item,
        a contact from a contact book. After a while, a new requirement is
        added. Solution must support companies that manage their contacts
        organized in files. We agreed to develop a web application that would
        support upload of dataset files, like .csv. The new web application
        should support third party integrations. Some of them are the ESP/CRM
        services, like Mailchimp. User does not need to see the result
        immediately. System can later notify the user about the result, when the
        process finishes. This information is the key that we need to leverage
        on when developing our solution. So here’s how we did it.
      </p>
      <h2>Initial approach</h2>
      <p>
        Our initial approach went like this: The web application would read a
        .csv file line-by-line and submit an array of entries to the backend
        REST API. Processing is in real time, immediately after the user makes a
        request for the process to start, he expects a result. Another approach
        is to apply vertical scaling to AWS architecture. Meaning we used
        larger, more expensive instances that have more RAM and processing
        power. This system worked well for smaller datasets, maybe up to 5k
        entries, but for larger datasets multiple problems arose. This solution
        is prone to failure due to long request time. Also, because of some 3rd
        party services that aren’t optimized for large scale loads or they don’t
        have batch endpoints. 3rd party services also tend to protect their
        architecture from making a huge bill on their end. The whole process was
        done in real-time. The request can take a lot of time hanging in there
        while the backend would do all the work and return the result to the
        client. The request was limited to 300 seconds (at time of writing the
        article) before AWS would cancel it… Also I need to mention that the
        user has to wait a few minutes to see the results. They can’t use the
        app during the process, which makes for a bad user experience.
